## Academics

[ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu/) is a very broad major an. I am currently enrolled in **ENGL396: Software Documentation**.


Here is a list of my favorite classes at UW:

- [Databases and Data Modeling](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/INFO330?states=N4Ig7gDgziBcLADrgJYDsAmB7MAJApigOYAWALsrAIwCsALAEwA0yY62YACllCmSljSUGANgC%2BIMUA)

- [Introduction to Professional and Technical Writing](https://english.washington.edu/courses/2024/winter/engl/288/g)

## Programming Background

I am relatively new to programming. The following table summarizes my experience with different programming languages:

| Language | Experience |
|---------:|------------|
| Python   | Minimal    |
|  HTML    | Authored many web pages    |
|  SQL     | Can write complex joins       |


## Words of Wisdom

One of my favorite quotes is from Albert Einstein:

> "The only thing that you absolutely have to know, is the location of the library."
